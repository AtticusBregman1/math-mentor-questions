\noindent The equation of line \(l\) is \(y=\frac{2}{3}x\), and the equation of line \(m\) is \(y=-2x+8\). The intersection of line \(l\) and \(m\) is marked as point \(A\), the intersection of line \(m\) and the x-axis is marked as point \(B\), and the intersection of line \(m\) and the y-axis is marked as point \(C\).\footnote{Toho University High School, Chiba}\\

\noindent (1): Draw a perpendicular line from the origin to \(m\), and let \(P\) be the point of intersection with \(m\). Find the coordinates of point \(P\).\\
\textit{Hint: When line \(y=ax+b\) and line \(y=cx+d\) are perpendicular, \(a\times c=-1\).}\\

\noindent (2): Find the equation of line \(n\) that passes through point \(A\), and splits triangle \(OBC\) into two triangles with equal areas.\\
