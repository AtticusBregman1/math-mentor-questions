\noindent Two lines exist on a coordinate plane : \(l: y = x-4\) and line \(m\) contains points \(A(6,0)\) and \(B(0,3)\). \(l\)'s intersection with the x-axis, y-axis, and \(m\) is marked as \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\), respectively. Point \(P\) lies on \(l\) and its x-coordinate is always greater than the x-coordinate of \(E\). Given this information, answer the questions below.\\

\noindent (1): Find the equation of \(m\).\\

\noindent (2): Find the coordinates of \(E\).\\

\noindent (3): Find the coordinates of \(P\) such that the area of \(BDE\) and \(AEP\) are equal.\\

\noindent (4): Find the coordinates of \(P\) such that \(ADP\) is an isosceles triangle with \(AD=AP\).\\
