\noindent In the figure below, a triangle has points \(O(0,0),\) \(A(0,6),\) and \(B(-3,0)\). Given this information, answer the questions below. For calculations requiring \(\pi\), leave \(\pi\) as a variable.\footnote{Mie Prefecture}\\

\noindent (1): Find the equation of the line that passes through \(AB\).\\

\noindent (2): Find the volume of the 3-dimensional figure created when \(OAB\) is rotated \(360^\circ\) about the y-axis.\\

\noindent (3): Find the volume of the 3-dimensional figure created when \(OAB\) is rotated \(360^\circ\) about the x-axis.\\

\noindent (4): Line \(l\) is a line that contains \((2,0)\) and is parallel to the y-axis. Find the volume of the 3-dimensional figure created when \(OAB\) is rotated \(360^\circ\) about line \(l\).\\
