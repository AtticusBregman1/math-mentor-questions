\noindent As shown in the figure below, the two points of intersection between lines \(y=-x+9\) and\\ \(y=\frac{a}{x}(a>0)\) is marked as \(A\) and \(B\). The intersection of \(y=-x+9\) with the x-axis and the y-axis are also marked as \(P\) and \(Q\), with \(QA=AB=BP\). Given this information, find the value of \(a\).\footnote{Yamagata Prefecture}\\
