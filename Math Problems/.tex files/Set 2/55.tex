\noindent Find the values of \(w, x, y,\) and  \(z\).\footnote{Waseda High School, Tokyo}\\

\noindent The x-coordinate of Point \(A\) is 9, which is also the intersection of lines

(1): \(5x-6y=a\) 

(2): \(y=bx+b\)

\noindent where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, and \(b>1\).\\

\noindent (1): In terms of \(a\), the y-coordinate of \(A\) is \(w\).\\

\noindent (2): The area of the triangle created by the two lines and the y-axis is \(\frac{81}{4}\). Given this information, \(a=x\) and \(b=y\). Therefore, the coordinates of \(A\) is \((9,z)\).
