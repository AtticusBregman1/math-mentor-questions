\noindent The intersection of \(y=-x+4\) and the x-axis is marked as point \emph{A}, and the intersection of \(y=-x+4\) and \(y=-x\) is marked as point \(B\). Additionally, the origin is marked as point \(O\). If \(y=ax\) splits triangle \(OAB\) into two triangles with equal areas, find the value of \(a\). \footnote{Wayoh Kohnodai Girls' High School, Chiba}\\
