\noindent In the figure below, a triangle has points \(A(0,4),\) \(B(-2,0),\) and \(C(6,0)\). Point \(P\) is a non-stationary point that lies on segment \(AC\), and point \(Q\) is a point that lies on the extension of segment \(OP\), where \(O\) represents the origin. The areas of \(ABO\) and \(QAC\) are always equal. Given this information, answer the questions below.\footnote{Toho High School, Tokyo}\\

\noindent (1): Find the equation of \(AC\).\\

\noindent (2): Find the coordinates of \(Q\) when \(OP\) splits the area of \(ABC\) in half.\\

\noindent (3): Find the area of the polygon formed by the motion of segment \(PQ\) when \(P\) has fully traveled the distance of \(AC\).\\
