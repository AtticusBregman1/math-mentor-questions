\noindent Three points, \(O(0,0)\), \(A(8,4)\), and \(B(2,16\) exist of on a 2D plane.\footnote{Hakodate La Salle High School, Hokkaido}\\

\noindent (1): Find the area of triangle \(OAB\).\\

\noindent (2): Find the equation of a line that passes through point \(A\), and splits triangle \(OAB\) into two triangles with equal areas.\\

\noindent (3): Find the equation of a line that passes through point \(P(2,1\), and splits triangle \(OAB\) into two triangles with equal areas.\\
\noindent \textit{Hint: Line \(BP\) is parallel to the y-axis.}
