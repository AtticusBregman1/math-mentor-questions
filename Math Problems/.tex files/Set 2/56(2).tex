\noindent In the figure below, the equations of the three functions are: \(l: y=\frac{a}{x}, m:y=x+5, n:y=3x-3\). \(l\)'s intersection with \(m\) at \(x=-6\) is marked as \(A\), \(l\)'s intersection with \(n\) at \(y=-6\) is marked as \(B\), the intersection of \(m\) and \(n\) is marked as \(C\), and the intersection of \(n\) and the x-axis is marked as \(D\). Given this information, answer the questions below.\footnote{Kochi Prefecture}\\

\noindent (1): Find the value of \(a\).\\

\noindent (2): Find the coordinates of \(C\).\\

\noindent (3): Let \(E\) be the point of intersection between \(AB\) and the line that passes through \(D\) and is parallel to \(m\). Find the coordinates of \(E\).\\
