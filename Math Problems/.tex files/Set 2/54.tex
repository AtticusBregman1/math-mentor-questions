\noindent As shown in the figure below, Point \(P \) moves at a constant speed from Point \(O (0,0)\) along \(OA\) towards \(A(3,4)\). Point \(Q\) moves at a constant speed from Point \(B(4,0)\) along \(BC\) towards \(C(0,3)\). Given this information, answer the questions below.\footnote{Tokyo Gakugei University High School}\\

\noindent (1): Find the coordinates of Point \(D\), the intersection of \(OA\) and \(BC\).\\

\noindent (2): It takes 5 seconds for \(P\) to arrive at \(A\). At what time \(t\) does \(P\) cross \(D\)?\\

\noindent (3): It takes 5 seconds for \(Q\) to arrive at \(C\). If \(P\) and \(Q\) leave their respective starting positions at the same time, find the value of \(t\) where segment \(PQ\) is parallel to the y-axis.\\
\textit{Hint: When \(P\) and \(Q\) have the same x-coordinate, they form a line parallel to the y-axis.}
