\noindent Four points, \(A(2,3),B(2,-1),C(5,8),D(3,6)\), are connected to form a trapezoid. The coordinates of point \(E\) is \((0,2)\). Find the equation of the line that passes through point \(E\) and splits the area of \(ABCD\) in half.\footnote{Rikkyo Niiza High School, Saitama}\\
\noindent \textit{Hint: Find the midpoint of the two bases of the trapezoid. Create a segment connecting these midpoints, and let \(M\) the midpoint of this segment. The area of a trapezoid can be cut in half when a line crosses both bases and \(M\).}\\
