\noindent Two lines, \(l: y=-2x+10,\) \(m:y=\frac{1}{2}x\) intersect at point \(A\). As shown in the figure below, \(P\) lies on segment \(OA\), and a line parallel to the y-axis is drawn until it intersects with \(l\), which is marked as \(Q\). Lines parallel to the x-axis are drawn from \(P\) and \(Q\), and their intersections with the y-axis are marked as \(R\) and \(S\), respectively. Given this information, answer the questions below.\footnote{Toho University High School, Chiba}\\

\noindent (1): Find the coordinates of \(A\).\\

\noindent (2): Let \(t\) be the x-coordinate of \(P\). Find the length of \(PQ\) in terms of \(t\).\\

\noindent (3): Find the coordinates of \(Q\) such that \(PQSR\) is a square.\\
